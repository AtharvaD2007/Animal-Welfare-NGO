        <p id="p1">PETA supporters are making the world a more compassionate place for animals, and your gift today can
            help. Giving as little as $5 can provide a neglected dog with a week's worth of food, and a gift of $350 can
            help supply PETA investigators with the resources that they need to expose—and ultimately stop—animal abuse
            wherever it occurs.</p>
        <p id="p2"><b>You can be confident that your contribution to PETA will go straight to work helping
                animals</b>—by ending horrifying experiments, funding investigations to expose cruelty on massive farms,
            stopping animals from being abused and killed for their skin, rescuing dogs and cats from neglect, and much
            more.</p>
        <p id="p2"><b>Together, we're making the world a better place for all beings.</b> Please, give what you can
            today.</p><br><br>
